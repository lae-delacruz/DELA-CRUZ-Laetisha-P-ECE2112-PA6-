## This repository contains the MATLAB (.m) files for the three problems in PA6.

**The .mfiles demonstrate the use of functions and the MATLAB Editor Window.**


### PROBLEM #1: CLASSIFYCONIC
- The function **`classifyconic`** accepts parameters `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, and `F` of a conic section to determine whether it is a **parabola**, **ellipse**, or **hyperbola**.  
- The discriminant **B² − 4AC** is used as the basis for classification.  
- An **if–else** statement filters the given parameters between the three types.  
- The program can be called and successfully run in the Command Window.

### PROBLEM #2: OBLIQUE TRIANGLE
- The function **`sidelength`** accepts user inputs for the side values of `a` and `b`, and the angle `C` in degrees.  
- The formula **c = sqrt(a² + b² − 2ab cosd(C))** is used to determine the value of side `c`.  
- The program can be called and successfully run in the Command Window.

### PROBLEM #3: ISOLATE EVEN AND ODD
- The function **`isolateloop`** initializes empty vectors `even` and `odd` to store values.  
- An **if–else** statement is used to separate even and odd integers.  
- The program can be called and successfully run in the Command Window.  
- The function **`isolate_noloop`** performs the same task **without using loops**, applying the modulo operation directly to separate values.  
- This program can also be called and successfully run in the Command Window.
